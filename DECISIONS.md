# HirePilot — Decisions

Autonomous decisions taken without asking, per §7. Newest last.

## D1 — G0.1 shipped before this prompt arrived
The backlog's first goal was already complete from the prior session: real
counters, `/api/jobs/stats`, three passing tests. Re-running it would be a
no-op. ASSESS treats it as shipped and selects G0.2.

## D2 — supertest added as a dev dependency (G0.1)
Needed to assert on HTTP status codes, which is the whole point of the "503
rather than a zeroed body" criterion. Test-only; not in the runtime bundle.

## D3 — G0.2: render facts, not screenshots of a seeded demo account
The criterion offered "a real screenshot from a seeded demo account, or removed".
Chose neither literally: screenshots go stale silently and cannot be verified at
runtime, and the panels can show something better than an image - the actual
weights, guard rules and status vocabulary from shipped code.

The scoring panel is the load-bearing case. A score requires a user's own skills
and experience; a logged-out visitor has none, so there is no real number to put
there. Showing the four weights (40/30/20/10, cited to matchingEngine.js) states
how the product works without inventing a result it cannot compute. A test
asserts these weights still equal the engine's, so the page cannot drift into
lying about its own maths.

## D4 — jest added to the frontend workspace
No test runner existed there. Needed for the landing-honesty regression guard.
Test-only.
